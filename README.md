## [Project #1 - Career Track Analysis](https://365datascience.com/projects/career-track-analysis-with-sql-and-tableau/)

One of the functionalities the 365 company introduced in a 2021 platform release included the option for student enrollment in a career track. The tracks represent an ordinal sequence of courses that eventually lead to obtaining the skills for one of three job titles: data scientist, data analyst, or business analyst.

Completing a career track on the platform is a challenging task. To acquire a corresponding career certificate, a student must pass nine course exams (seven compulsory and two elective courses) and sit for a career track exam encompassing topics from all seven required courses.

In this Career Track Analysis with SQL and Tableau project, you’re tasked with analyzing the career track enrollments and achievements of 365’s students. You’ll first need to retrieve the necessary information from an SQL database. Afterward, you’ll feed this information to Tableau, visualize the results, and finally interpret them.

## [Project #2 - Newfeed Analysis](https://365datascience.com/projects/newsfeed-analysis-in-tableau/)

**Overview:**
* In this Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau project, you’ll tackle a real-world case and gain hands-on experience optimizing a website’s newsfeed feature for maximum user engagement. Dive deep into a real-life database, perform data analysis in Tableau, and unearth crucial insights that can enhance your professional portfolio and skillset.

**Objective:**
* Your main goal is to generate graphs that analyze users’ interaction patterns with the 365 platform’s Newsfeed service. For this purpose, you must craft a data visualization in Tableau that captures critical findings from 01-01-2023 to 05-31-2023. Build this Tableau dashboard from scratch, utilizing it to deduce necessary conclusions and recommend potential refinements.

## [Project #3 - Student Onboarding Analysis](https://365datascience.com/projects/student-onboarding-analysis-in-tableau/)

**Backgound:**
* An onboarding survey, in essence, is a structured questionnaire or feedback mechanism employed by online platforms to gain insights into new users' experiences and expectations during their initial interaction with the platform. This Student Onboarding Analysis in Tableau project delves into the onboarding experience of students using an e-learning platform. By analyzing customer onboarding survey data, we seek to understand better how students discover the platform, their learning aspirations, and ultimate career goals.

**Objective:**
* The critical aspect of this project is the development of an interactive dashboard in Tableau. The dashboard will showcase the survey completion trends over time and across different countries. It will present visualizations depicting how students discovered the platform, their desired learning areas, and career goals.
A crucial part is adding several interactive filters allowing users to slice and dice the data based on variables, such as registration date, survey completion date, student country, and subscription status and type. This will give stakeholders a dynamic and robust tool to derive insights from the onboarding survey data effectively.

## [Project #4 - Checkout Flow Optimization Analysis](https://365datascience.com/projects/checkout-flow-optimization-analysis-with-sql-and-tableau/)

**Overview:**
* In this project, we invite you to embark on a practical, real-world case centered around optimizing an online platform’s checkout flow. The goal of the analysis is to enhance the purchase experience for users on the 365 webpage—a critical aspect of online retail that directly impacts conversion rates and customer satisfaction. You'll delve into an actual database, discover crucial insights, and acquire practical experience enhancing the website's purchase checkout system.

**Objective:** 
* The primary goal is to analyze the 365 platform’s checkout process by devising and building from the ground up a three-page story-based dashboard, displaying key metrics, insights, and visualizations for 07-01-2022 to 01-31-2023. Studying the final Tableau story will help you draw conclusions and suggest potential enhancements. Based on your analysis, you must develop a strategy to improve the checkout process and enhance the user payment experience.

## [Project #5 - Customer Engagement Analysis](https://365datascience.com/projects/customer-engagement-analysis-with-sql-and-tableau/)

**Overview:**
* Our Customer Engagement Analysis with SQL and Tableau project offers an exceptional opportunity to enhance and expand your professional portfolio. Your task is to build a three-page dashboard including key metrics and visualizations that aims to show student engagement with the 365 platform and identify critical areas of improvement. 

**Objective:** 
* The following is a list of the questions we want our dashboard to answer:
  * Which courses are the most watched by students, and how are they rated?
  * How many students register each month, and what fraction are also onboarded?
  * How do students engage with the platform (minutes and average minutes watched) based on student type (free-plan or paying)?
  * Do students watch more content with time, and does it vary seasonally?
  * Which countries have the most students registered, and does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?
